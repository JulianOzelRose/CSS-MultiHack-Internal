# Counter-Strike: Source - Internal Multihack
This is a simple multihack for Counter-Strike: Source. Its features include
aimbot, triggerbot, anti-flash, and bunnyhop hack. It is an internal hack,
so you will need a DLL injector. For more details on installation and use,
scroll down to the installation and use section.

## Installation and use
To download this hack, navigate to the [build](https://github.com/JulianOzelRose/CSS-MultiHack-Internal/tree/master/CSS-MultiHack-Internal/build)
folder, then download ```CSS-MultiHack-Internal.dll```. You will then need to use a DLL injector.
I reccommend using [this one](https://guidedhacking.com/resources/guided-hacking-dll-injector.4/).
Once you have the injector, select the process for Counter-Strike: Source, then open the DLL,
then press inject. The multihack should then be running. To hide the menu, press the ```INSERT``` Key.
To unload the hack, press the ```END``` key on your numpad. From the menu, you can toggle the
different features on or off. To run the aimbot, press the ```V``` key.

## Warning
This program reads and modifies memory internally. If you use it on a VAC-secured server,
you will be banned. To prevent this, be sure to add the ```-insecure``` flag to your
game's launch options. You can find this menu by right-clicking on your game from Steam,
then going to Properties. You can then safely play against bots without worrying
about catching a VAC ban.
